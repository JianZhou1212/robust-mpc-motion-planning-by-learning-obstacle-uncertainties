## Packages for running the code
To run the code you need to install the following key packages:

**CasADi**: https://web.casadi.org/

**HSL Solver**: https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl

**pytope**: https://pypi.org/project/pytope/

Note: Installing the HSL package can be a bit comprehensive, but the solvers just speed up the solutions. You can comment out the places where the HSL solver is used, i.e., "ipopt.linear_solver": "ma57", and just use the default linear solver of CasADi. 

## Introduction to the files
(1) `main.ipynb` is the main file for simulation.

(2) `ModelingSVTrue.py` defines the nonlinear MPC controller for simulating the SV.

(3) `Planner_D.py` defines the deterministic MPC (DMPC) planner.

(4) `Planner_R.py` defines the robust MPC (RMPC) planner.

(5) `Planner_N.py` defines the proposed MPC planner.

The code for the other case studies will be published soon, while the other case studies are implemented by the same methods.
