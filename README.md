## Packages for running the code
To run the code you need to install the following key packages:

**CasADi**: https://web.casadi.org/

**HSL Solver**: https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl

**pytope**: https://pypi.org/project/pytope/

Note: Installing the HSL package can be a bit comprehensive, but the solvers just speed up the solutions. You can comment out the places where the HSL solver is used, i.e., "ipopt.linear_solver": "ma57", and just use the default linear solver of CasADi.
